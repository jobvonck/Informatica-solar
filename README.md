# Informatica Solar Powered House

**Accelerating the Green Energy Transition with Innovation**

This project represents an innovative step towards a greener future. It was developed as part of the [PAPI Awards NL](https://www.kijkophetnoorden.nl/scholieren-van-groningse-gomaruscollege-winnen-prijzen-tijdens-de-5e-raspberry-pi-finale/), where our team was honored with the first prize in the feasibility category. We've designed an invention that optimizes energy utilization from solar panels by intelligently storing and managing power, harnessing the sun's energy to its fullest potential. Additionally, our system utilizes an API to monitor electricity prices and sells excess power when the rates are at their peak.

## Features

- **Solar Power Optimization:** Our system intelligently manages solar power, ensuring maximum utilization and storage.
- **Peak Pricing Strategy:** We leverage an API to monitor electricity prices, selling excess power during peak rate hours.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Control and monitor your smart house through an intuitive dashboard and a mobile website.
- **Relay Control:** Easily manage connected devices using the relay control panel simulated through lights.
- **Small Scale Replica:** We have created a small scale replica of our idea using Raspberry pi, Battery, Solar panel and Relay board.
